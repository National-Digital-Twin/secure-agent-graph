# Installation
**Repository:** `secure-agent-graph` 

**Description:** `This file provides detailed installation steps, including required dependencies and configurations for Secure Agent Graph.` 

<!-- SPDX-License-Identifier: OGL-UK-3.0 -->

Secure Agent Graph (SAG) provides [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql-overview/) access using the [SPARQL
protocol](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql-protocol/) and [SPARQL Graph Store
Protocol](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql-graph-store-protocol/) to RDF data with [ABAC data
security](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/rdf-abac/blob/main/docs/abac.md).

## Starting installation
1. Run:
```
mvn clean install
```
2. Start the app through either
- Docker or
- Java

## Starting the app using Docker
To launch a simple server with no authentication:
1. Go to the 'sag-docker' directory
2. Run the script:
```
./docker-run.sh --config config/config-abac-local.ttl
```
This will build the docker image containing the application, and mount the 'mnt' directories within.

 3. Build a Docker image using:
 ```
build-arg PROJECT_VERSION="<YOUR PROJECT VERSION>
```
This will build the docker image and mount it to a port of your choosing. Please see the example Docker compose file in the docker-compose directory. 

4. Load data into the Docker image: Run the load-data script within 'sag-docker/Test' directory (within a separate terminal window).
 
This will load sample data for testing purposes only - assuming you are running on port 3030.
 
## Starting the app using Java
Java application can be run using the following commands:
```
USER_ATTRIBUTES_URL=http://localhost:8091 JWKS_URL=disabled \                                                  
java \
-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 \
-Dsun.stdout.encoding=UTF-8 \
-Dsun.stderr.encoding=UTF-8 \
-classpath "sag-server/target/classes:sag-system/target/classes:sag-docker/target/dependency/*" \
uk.gov.dbt.ndtp.secure.agent.graph.SecureAgentGraph \
--config sag-docker/mnt/config/config-abac-local.ttl
```
In the above, the 'JWKS_URL' is disabled but can be set to the JWKS url for your identity provider and 'USER_ATTRIBUTES_URL' referes to the address that the IA NODE access application is running on.

## Example configuration
Secure Agent Graph is configured using a Fuseki configuration file
([documentation](docs/configuration-secure-agent-graph.md)). There is an [example config.ttl](docs/config.ttl) file.

You can find further example configurations later under [Try It Out](#try-it-out).

## System Configuration
The following environment variables can be used to control Secure Agent Graph:

### `USER_ATTRIBUTES_URL`
This is the network location of [user attribute server](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/ianode-access) which also
includes the hierarchies management.

The URL value is a template including `{user}`. Example: `http://some-host/users/lookup/{user}`

### `JWKS_URL`
This specifies the JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) URL to use to obtain the public keys for verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).
The value "disabled" turns off token verification.

## Build
Building Secure Agent Graph is a two-step process.

The java artifacts are built using the maven release plugin. When these are released, the docker container is
automatically built.

Check versions in `release-setup`.

### Build and release the secure agent graph maven artifacts

On branch `main`:

Edit and commit `release-setup` to set the correct versions.

```
source release-setup
```

This prints the dry-run command.  If you need to change this file, edit it, then simply source the file again.

Dry run:

```
mvn $MVN_ARGS -DdryRun=true release:clean release:prepare
```

and for real:

```
mvn $MVN_ARGS release:clean release:prepare
```

This updates the version number.  Our automated GitHub Actions pipelines handles publishing the release build to Maven
Central and Docker Hub.

After release, do `git pull` to sync local and remote git repositories.

To rebuild for update version for development:

```
mvn clean install
```

### About the Docker Container

The docker container is automatically built by github action on a release of the Secure Agent Graph jar artifacts.

In the docker container we have:

```
    /fuseki/logs/
    /fuseki/databases/
    /fuseki/config/
```

and configuration files go into host `mnt/config/`.

### Try it out! 

The provided script, [docker-run.sh](sag-docker/docker-run.sh), runs SAG in a docker container, with the contents of the
local [mnt/config](sag-docker/mnt/config) directory mounted into the newly generated docker image for ease of use.
Similarly, the [mnt/databases](sag-docker/mnt/databases) and [mnt/logs](sag-docker/mnt/logs) are moutned for easier
analysis.

#### Example configuration - *Default*

```bash
   sag-docker/docker-run.sh
```
Passing no parameters means that it will default to (`"--mem /ds"`)

It specifies an in-memory dataset at "/ds" which replays the "RDF" topic on start-up. It assumes that Kafka must be up
and running, prior to launch.

The Fuseki server is available at `http://localhost:3030/ds`.

#### Example configuration - *ABAC*
```bash
   sag-docker/docker-run.sh --config config/config-local-abac.ttl
```
This runs the server using the configuration file [config-abac-local.ttl](sag-docker/mnt/config/config-abac-local.ttl.
It specifies an in-memory dataset at `/ds` and that Attribute Based Access Control is enabled.

*Note:* See caveat below re: authentication.


#### Example configuration - *Kafka Replay* 

```bash
   sag-docker/docker-run.sh --config config/config-replay-abac.ttl
```
As this suggests, this runs server using the configuration file `config/config-replay-abac.ttl` 
or [config-replay-abac.ttl](sag-docker/mnt/config/config-replay-abac.ttl) as it's known locally. 

It specifies an in-memory dataset at "/ds" which replays the "RDF" topic on start-up. It assumes that Kafka must be up
and running, prior to launch.

The Fuseki server is available at `http://localhost:3030/ds`.

#### More advanced testing - d-run

Alternately, you can use the script `d-run` which will map the relevant config and database directories from the local
filesystem, pulling down the given image and running it directly (not in `-d` mode). It requires a number of environment
variables to be set as indicated in the script. 

It can be run with exactly the same configuration as docker-run.sh except with no default configuration if nothing is
provided.

#### Open Telemetry

Open Telemetry for SAG will be enabled if any environment variables with `OTEL` in the name are present at runtime.  If
this is not the case then the Open Telemetry Agent is not attached to the JVM and no metrics/traces will be exported.
