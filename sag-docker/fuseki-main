## ---- JVM

# One database setup.

## ---- Logging
## Fuseki use Apache Log4j2 for logging.
## Set the logging via the usual log4j2 mechanisms
##   https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/configuration.html
## There is a built-in setup

## Built-in Fuseki logging setup: in order:
## 1/ Check for Log4j2 normal setup:  -Dlog4j2.configurationFile= etc.
## 2/ Look for  file:log4j2.properties (current directory)
## 3/ Classpath:  log4j2.properties
## 4/ Built-in setup.
##   By default: Usually (3) will find the logging.

## To debug Fuseki logging setup: set environment variable
## FUSEKI_LOGLOGGING or system property "fuseki.loglogging" to "true"

## Log4j2: Setting log4j2 with some other file.
##  Environment variable: LOG4J_CONFIGURATION_FILE
##  SystemProperty log4j2.configurationFile
